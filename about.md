Welcome y'all! I'm a Backend Developer based in Vienna, Austria. 

I mostly code in Ruby and Elixir. Check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grzegorz-jakubiak-668213116) out if you want to know more about my professional experience.

Apart from coding, I do enjoy any kind of sport and physical activity. All in all, I do what everybody does i.e. draw, read books, watch movies and try to stay sane in this crazy world.
