Nobody knows I became a huge Venezia FC fan this year. This happened after I visited Venice, Italy for the first time this July.
The beauty of the lagoon city stunned me, and I learned they have a Serie A competing football club there.

I've been following the club ever since their first game in September. I've been checking the schedule making sure not to miss any game. This became a tedious process, and I came up with an idea. 

"Why don't I write an elixir app?"

### The APP

I found this would be good practice for my elixir skills. So, I fired up my VS Code and started typing.

What I came up with is a simple elixir app called [Venezia](https://github.com/grzegorz-jakubiak/venezia). One can use it to get a schedule of their favorite Serie A team. It's easy, you need to clone the app and launch it:
```
iex -S mix
```

```elixir
Venezia.Schedule.get_schedule("venezia")
```

Et voilà, you get a team schedule in a list of maps.

### Learnings

Although it's a simple app I still managed to learn about [poolboy](https://github.com/devinus/poolboy) an erlang library for connection pooling.
