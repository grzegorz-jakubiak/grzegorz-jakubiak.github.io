No one knows that I became a big fan of Venezia FC this year. This happened after I visited Venice, Italy for the first time in July this year.
I was overwhelmed by the beauty of the lagoon city, and I learned that there is a Serie A football club there.

I have been following the club since its first game in September. I have been looking at the fixture list and making sure not to miss a game. This was becoming a tedious task, and that's when an idea came to me. 

"Why do not I write an Elixir app?"

### The APP

I thought this would be good practice for my elixir skills. So I fired up my VS code and started typing.

What came out is a simple elixir app called [Venezia](https://github.com/grzegorz-jakubiak/venezia). With it, you can access the fixture list of your favorite Serie A team. It's very simple: you need to clone the app and launch it.
```
iex -S mix
```

```elixir
Venezia.Schedule.get_schedule("venezia")
```

Et voilà, you get a team schedule in a list of maps.

### Learnings

Although it's a simple app I still managed to learn about [poolboy](https://github.com/devinus/poolboy) an erlang library for connection pooling.
