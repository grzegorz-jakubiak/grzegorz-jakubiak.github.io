Last week I had a great opportunity to participate in ElixirConf EU 2021 organized in Warsaw, Poland.

It was my second elixir conference but the first one in-person. It was great to see all of the speakers there on the stage.
I want to share some highlights of my conference experience. 

I am still new to the elixir community. It's been only one year since I started coding in the language. This made it hard for me to pick the talks.

Anyway, I compiled a list of the talks that I enjoyed:
* **Going Multi-Node with ExUnit** by Devon Estes - Devon talked about making ExUnit running concurrently. Key takeaways are `:code` and `:rpc` erlang libraries. If you like me didn't know about them be sure to check them out.

* **Control Node: Continuous Delivery and Orchestration as code for Elixir** by Vanshdeep Singh - essentially kubernetes built with Elixir.

* **Love Your Crash Dumps** by Michał Ślaski - Michał presented a comprehensive set of tools one can use to inspect the performance of their application.

* **Keynote: Clarity** by Saša Jurić - great talk on how to avoid confusion. The examples were in Elixir, but the concepts are language agnostic.
I'd recommend every developer to check it out.

* **Doing weird things with Ecto** by Nikola Begedin - Nikola gave a nice examples of validations and polymorphism in Ecto.

* **The pillars of Metaprogramming in Elixir** by Adi Iyengar - Adi showed me that metaprogramming in Elixir isn't as scary as it looks. It was a good introduction into the topic.

* **A safer Elixir** by Esteban Ibarra - I found out that pattern matching, guards, and structs are really your best friends. They help you to build safe and readable code.

All in all, it was an awesome event, and I'm very grateful I took part in it.
