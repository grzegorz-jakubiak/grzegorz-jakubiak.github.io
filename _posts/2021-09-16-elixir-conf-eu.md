Last week I had the great opportunity to attend ElixirConf EU 2021, organized in Warsaw, Poland.

It was my second Elixir conference, but the first one I attended in person. It was great to see all the speakers there on stage.
I would like to share some highlights of my conference experience with you. 

I am still new to the Elixir community. It's only been a year since I started programming in this language. This made it hard for me to choose the talks.

Anyway, I have compiled a list of talks that I liked:
* **Going Multi-Node with ExUnit** by Devon Estes - Devon talked about how to run ExUnit concurrently. The key takeaways are the Erlang libraries ':code' and ':rpc'. If, like me, you did not know about these yet, you should definitely check them out.

* **Control Node: Continuous Delivery and Orchestration as code for Elixir** by Vanshdeep Singh - essentially Kubernetes with Elixir.

**Love Your Crash Dumps** by Michał Ślaski - Michał presented a comprehensive set of tools to check the performance of your application.

* **Keynote: Clarity** by Saša Jurić - great talk on how to avoid clutter. The examples were in Elixir, but the concepts are language independent.
I recommend every developer to watch the talk.

**Doing weird things with Ecto** by Nikola Begedin - Nikola gave a nice example of validations and polymorphism in Ecto.

**The Pillars of Metaprogramming in Elixir** by Adi Iyengar - Adi showed me that metaprogramming in Elixir is not as scary as it looks. It was a good introduction to the subject.

**A Safer Elixir** by Esteban Ibarra - I found that pattern matching, guards, and structs are really your best friends. They help you create safe and readable code.

All in all, it was a great event and I am very grateful to have attended.
