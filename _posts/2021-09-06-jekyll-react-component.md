I've recently learned that you can finally use JavaScript `import` natively in the browser. I've decided to try it out.

Ever thought of integrating jekyll with React so you can render components directly? 
... 

Yes, sir! 

Then gather round the fireplace, and I'll spin the tale.

# The tale

The support of `import` in the browser means you can use any ES module directly. Using websites like e.g. [ESM](https://esm.sh/) which is a CDN for `npm` packages you are able to add any dependency to your modules.

This is great, but with React there is one problem. We are used to `JSX` syntax. However, `JSX` requires transpilation which is not available in the browser.

Fortunately, there's an alternative - [HTM(Hyperscript Tagged Markup)](https://github.com/developit/htm). Using **HTM** it is possible to write slightly modified `JSX` syntax.

I put all of these together and built [jekyll-react-component](https://github.com/grzegorz-jakubiak/jekyll-react-component). It adds a `react_component` tag to jekyll. You can use that to write React components like so

{% raw %}
```
{% react_component {"name": "ComponentName"} %}
... javascript code...
{% endreact_component %}
```
{% endraw %}

Et voilÃ :

{% react_component {"name": "Clock"} %}
import AnalogClock from 'https://esm.sh/analog-clock-react';


class Clock extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
        clockOptions: {
          width: "300px",
          border: true,
          borderColor: "#2e2e2e",
          baseColor: "#17a2b8",
          centerColor: "#459cff",
          centerBorderColor: "#fff",
          handColors: {
            second: "#d81c7a",
            minute: "#fff",
            hour: "#fff"
          }
        },
        date: new Date()
      };
    }

    componentDidMount() {
    this.timerID = setInterval(
      () => this.tick(),
      1000
    );
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timerID);
  }

  tick() {
    this.setState({
      date: new Date()
    });
  }

    render() {
      return html`<${AnalogClock} ...${this.state.clockOptions}/>`;
    }
}

{% endreact_component %}
