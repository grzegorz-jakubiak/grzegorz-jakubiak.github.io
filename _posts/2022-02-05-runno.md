It has been a while, and I have something special for y'all. Through this week's issue of Ruby Weekly ([#589](https://rubyweekly.com/issues/589)) I discovered [runno](https://runno.dev/). It is an in-browser code runner. It uses WebAssembly and supports multiple runtimes. Ruby is one of them, and that's what got me interested...

Ruby has added official support for [WASI based WebAssembly](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18462). This has prompted the maintainer of runno to [add support for Ruby](https://dev.to/taybenlor/how-i-got-ruby-snippets-to-run-client-side-in-less-than-a-day-4pbk) to his code runner.

runno has a web component responsible that you can add to your website, and it does the magic.

<runno-run runtime="ruby" editor controls>
  puts "Hello world!"
</runno-run>

<br>

We all know "Hello world", let's see what else it can do:

<runno-run runtime="ruby" editor controls>
  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  numbers.each { print "#{_1 ** 2} " }
</runno-run>

<br>

As we can see we can run any ruby code. Well... not exactly any. There are some limitations mentioned in the [Ruby pull request](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/5407).

I found out that runno doesn't really work in Firefox, and I created an [issue](https://github.com/taybenlor/runno/issues/183) on github. I also noticed the web component behaves weird sometimes, and doesn't show the full terminal with the output.

All in all, it's a great tool that I want to run code samples.

Take care!
