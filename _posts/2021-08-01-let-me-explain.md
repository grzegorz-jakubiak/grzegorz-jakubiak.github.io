To begin, let me explain what this blog will be about. It is my playground where I will share my thoughts, ideas, stories and code snippets.

I do not want it to have any particular structure, nor do I have anything in that direction in mind. 

I think of it as a bit of an experiment. I have actually wanted to start a blog for a while. But I was not sure how to start or if I should do it at all. 

My intention is not to just write or talk about programming, code and so on and so forth. I want to have a space where I can just write. The usual trial and error. That's why I want to point this out at the very beginning. 

I may write some of it in English, parts of it in German or French. (As I said, I do not have a plan yet). 

What I do have is the urge to discover something new. For this reason, the blog will not be a regular, strictly IT -related blog. I will write about things that come to my mind or that I observe. 

That may or may not be creative writing. **I do not know**. 

You may think it's a bunch of gibberish. **I do not care**. 

It's just something for me to see, read, and maybe even enjoy YOU - the internet. So, without further ado, I welcome you.

Have fun and peace out!!
