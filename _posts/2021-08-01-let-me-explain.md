I'd like to start off by explaining what this blog will be about. It's my playground where I will share my thoughts, ideas, stories and code snippets.

I don't want it to have a particular structure nor have I anything of that sort in my mind. 

I consider it a little experiment. I've actually wanted to kick off with a blog for a while. Being not sure how to really start or if I even should. 

My intention isn't only to write or talk about programming, code, and so on and so forth. I intend to have space where I can just write. The usual trial and error. So from the very beginning, I'd like to point it out. 

I may write some stuff in English; parts of it in German or French. (I haven't got a plan as I mentioned.) 

What I do have is an urge to explore something new. This is why the blog won't be a regular strict IT-related one. I'll write about things that come to my mind or I observe. 

It may be creative writing or not. **I don't know.** 

You may see it as a bunch of gibberish. **I don't care.** 

It's just something for me that YOU - the internet can see, read, and maybe even enjoy. So without further ado, I would like to warmly welcome you here. 

Have fun and peace out!!
