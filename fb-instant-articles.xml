                    <p>I don’t know if anybody ever reads this blog before but I decided to restart it! Let’s see where this takes me.</p>

<p>I got rid of all the old posts. The reason for that is easy: <strong>this is not a programming and whatnot blog anymore</strong>. I’ve got enough of that at work.</p>

<p>I don’t have a plan for it. I just want to write something regularly and in three different languages: English, German and French.</p>

<p>Without furhter ado let’s go!!</p>
